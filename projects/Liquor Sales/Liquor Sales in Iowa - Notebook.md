Prompt: "You’ve been hired as an analyst for a consulting company tasked with running a marketing campaign on liquor sales in Iowa. Various vendors want to increase their statewide marketing efforts, and your boss has asked you to analyze consumer purchasing data in order to make smarter decisions about upcoming campaigns. 

You’ll focus on how to allocate a marketing budget throughout the state. You could concentrate on specific types of liquor, counties in the state, or on a certain group of vendors.

In order to convert them to long-term customers, you should aggressively negotiate a wholesale discount for their most popular whiskey, vodka and rum products. Specifically, you should:
1. Focus on supplying whiskey, vodka and rum, specifically canadian whisky, 80 proof vodka, and spiced rum as these are the products that are most in-demand.
2. Focus on the following brands: Black Velvet, Hawkeye Vodka and Captain Morgan from those respective categories
3. Focus on building partnerships with and supplying stores in the following three counties: Polk, Linn and Scott
4. Focus on getting your product in the following high-revenue stores within those respective counties: 
    -Polk: 2633, 4829, 3420
    -Linn: 3385, 3773
    -Scott: 3952, 3354, 2625
5. In order to convert each store to a long-term customer, negotiate with them a bulk discount, making sure whenever possible to undercut other vendors while still keeping a healthy bottomline"
