##SQlite is pretty different than other RDBMS : It doesn't have a date/time type. You can only store dates as numbers or text.
##The function strftime() is able to extract date/time info from a date stored in a text column, but it only works if you respect the ISO8601 notation: YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS.SSS , which is not the case with your date.
